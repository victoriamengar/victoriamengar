This shiny app enables the user to change the cutpoint of a Kaplan-meier analysis of TCPTP pathway level in 25 Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients.
As it is a dataset with numeric values, it must be dichotomized in high and low following a cut point.
This cut point is chosen by the user with a slicer.

The .Rmd and the .html files are a presentation with all the instructions and an example of the output.
